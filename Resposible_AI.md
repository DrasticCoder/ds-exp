### Model Inte## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Drift Detection & Model Monitoring

### Statistical Drift Monitoring

- **PSI (Population Stability Index):** Monitors feature distribution changes
- **KS Test:** Statistical significance testing for distribution differences
- **Dashboard:** Interactive monitoring via Streamlit "üåä Drift" tab

### Drift Thresholds & Actions

- **PSI < 0.1:** ‚úÖ Stable - Continue monitoring
- **PSI 0.1‚Äì0.2:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium Drift - Enhanced monitoring, investigate causes
- **PSI ‚â• 0.2:** ‚ùå High Drift - Model retraining recommended

### Epidemiological Drift Considerations

- **Seasonal Patterns:** Account for seasonal disease variations
- **Emerging Pathogens:** Monitor for new disease emergence requiring model updates
- **Healthcare System Changes:** Track changes in healthcare capacity and response
- **Data Quality Drift:** Monitor for changes in reporting standards or data collection

### Monitoring Frequency

- **Real-time:** Automated drift alerts for PSI > 0.2
- **Weekly:** Comprehensive drift assessment across all features
- **Monthly:** Public health expert review of drift patterns
- **Quarterly:** Model performance and fairness re-evaluationility

- **Global Explanations:** Feature importance analysis showing which epidemiological factors drive risk predictions
- **Feature Categories:** Analysis by Epidemiological, Healthcare, Demographics, Environmental, and Geographic factors
- **Transparency Dashboard:** Interactive visualizations in "üìà Risk Analysis" and "üõ°Ô∏è Responsible AI" tabs

### Risk Communication

- **Clear Risk Definitions:**
  - **High Risk:** Case fatality rate > 1% OR Cases per 100k > 100
  - **Low Risk:** Case fatality rate ‚â§ 1% AND Cases per 100k ‚â§ 100
- **Uncertainty Quantification:** Probability scores with confidence intervals
- **Clinical Context:** Feature importance mapped to epidemiological significance

### Disclaimers & Limitations

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Medical Disclaimer:** This model provides statistical risk assessments based on population-level data. It is NOT a substitute for professional medical judgment, clinical diagnosis, or public health expert analysis.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Prediction Limitations:** Model trained on historical outbreak data and may not capture emerging disease patterns, novel pathogens, or rapidly changing epidemiological conditions.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Geographic Limitations:** Performance may vary across different healthcare systems, data quality, and regional reporting standards.Outbreak Risk Prediction System

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Purpose & Scope

- **Goal:** Predict disease outbreak risk classification (_Low Risk_ vs _High Risk_) based on epidemiological factors.
- **Use Case:** Public health monitoring, early warning systems, and resource allocation planning.
- **High-Risk Domain:** Medical/health predictions - requires human oversight and expert validation.
- **Not for:** Individual medical diagnosis, treatment decisions, or automated public health interventions.ble AI Checklist

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Purpose & Scope

- **Goal:** Predict if a product will be _In Stock_ or _Out of Stock_.
- **Use Case:** Internal analytics for supply & operations planning.
- **Not for:** Credit, hiring, or other high-risk decisions.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Governance

- ‚úÖ **No Personal Health Information (PHI)**: Dataset contains only aggregated, population-level health statistics.
- ‚úÖ **Public Health Data**: Includes epidemiological factors (`Cases_Reported`, `Deaths_Reported`, `Vaccination_Coverage_Pct`, etc.).
- ‚úÖ **Geographic Aggregation**: Country-level data only, no individual location tracking.
- ‚úÖ **Dataset Source**: Documented in `/app/artifacts/disease_outbreak_dataset_1500.csv`.
- ‚úÖ **Reproducibility**: Model artifacts and reference data tracked for version control.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Fairness & Bias Prevention

### Sensitive Attributes

- **Primary:** `Country` (geographic equity in health predictions)
- **Secondary:** `Disease_Name` (disease-specific fairness)
- **Monitoring:** Healthcare resource disparities, socioeconomic factors

### Fairness Metrics

- **Geographic Parity:** Equal prediction accuracy across countries/regions
- **Disease Equity:** Consistent performance across different disease types
- **Healthcare Access Fairness:** Account for varying healthcare expenditure levels
- **Threshold:** High-risk rate difference ‚â§ 0.15 between groups

### Action Framework

- **Green ‚â§ 0.15:** ‚úÖ Equitable predictions
- **Amber 0.15‚Äì0.25:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Monitor and investigate bias sources
- **Red > 0.25:** ‚ùå Immediate bias mitigation required

### Bias Mitigation Strategies

- **Data Balancing:** Ensure representative sampling across countries and diseases
- **Feature Engineering:** Include socioeconomic and healthcare access indicators
- **Threshold Optimization:** Country-specific risk thresholds if needed
- **Expert Validation:** Public health expert review of predictions

### Monitoring Protocol

- **Weekly:** Fairness audit via Streamlit "‚öñÔ∏è Fairness" tab
- **Monthly:** Geographic and disease-specific bias assessment
- **Quarterly:** Expert review of model fairness with public health professionals

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Explainability

- Global explainability via **SHAP summary plot** (top feature drivers).
- Local explainability via **LIME or SHAP waterfall**.
- SHAP and metrics visualized in ‚Äúüîé SHAP‚Äù tab.
- Each explanation includes disclaimer:
  > _Explanations are statistical approximations and not exact causal attributions._
